/* TODO: The [`CpuProfile`] struct will likely need a few more iterations. The following
sections should explain why:

# MSR restrictions

CPU profiles also need to restrict which MSRs may be manipulated by the guest as various physical CPUs
can have differing supported MSRs.

The CPU profile will thus necessarily need to contain some data related to MSR restrictions. That will
be taken care of in a follow up MR.

# Raw hardware CPUID for advanced opt-in features

Some more advanced CPU Features may either not be present when prompting the hypervisor for supported CPUID
enries (especially if this is done with the hypervisor in its default configuration), or may otherwise be
declared to be overwritten by all CPU profiles (as a safest default).

We may still want to let users opt-in to using such features if permitted by the hardware and hypervisor
however. Hence we may also want the `CpuProfile` to contain all CPUID entries obtained directly from the
hardware of the host the profile was built from.

This hardware information can then later be used on other hosts running under this pre-generated CPU
profile whenever the user wants to opt-in to more advanced CPU futures. If we can determine that the
feature is satisfied by both the hypervisor, the hardware of the host generating the profile, and the
current host then this should preserve live migration compatibility (unless the feature in inherently
incompatible with live migration of course).
